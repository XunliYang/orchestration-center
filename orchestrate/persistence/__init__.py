"""Storage ports the application owns, and the backends that implement them.

Importing this package must stay cheap and driver-free: the concrete backends
(and therefore ``psycopg2``/``pymysql``) are imported lazily by
:func:`orchestrate.persistence.factory.create`, so a file-mode deployment never
pays for a database driver it does not use.

The application layer should depend on :class:`StorageContext` and the port
interfaces below -- never on ``database.utils.*`` and never on
``persistence_mode`` directly.
