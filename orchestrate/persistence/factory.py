"""Single selection point: persistence mode -> backend instance.

Two rules this module exists to enforce:

* the list of known modes is *imported* from
  :mod:`common.util.persistence_mode`, never copied -- a second copy of the
  enumeration is how the registry service ended up with five lists to keep in
  sync whenever a backend was added;
* driver imports happen inside the builders, so a file-mode deployment never
  loads ``psycopg2`` or ``pymysql``.
