"""Storage failure types, owned by the application, raised by every backend.

Callers must be able to tell three situations apart, which the previous code
conflated: "not found" is a normal ``None``/``False`` return; "unavailable"
means a dependency is down and must never masquerade as an empty result; and
"corrupt" means stored data no longer decodes into the domain model.

    Also a ``RuntimeError`` for compatibility with existing authentication
    guards. Operation boundaries must raise this instead of returning empty
    results; exception inheritance alone does not classify database failures.
