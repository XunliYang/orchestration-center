"""Derive the one-line task summary shown in workflow search results.

This lives here, in the domain layer, rather than next to the database handlers:
both the file backend and the SQL backend need the same summary, so keeping it
in ``orchestrate.handlers.psop_processor`` forced the storage layer to import
the handler layer (a reverse dependency).
