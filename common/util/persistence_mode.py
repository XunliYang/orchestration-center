"""Single source of truth for the ``persistence_mode`` configuration flag.

``persistence_mode`` selects the workflow-storage backend: ``file`` (default)
keeps JSON documents under ``data/workflow_storage/``; ``postgresql`` switches
the pluggable handlers to the database-backed implementations (and, for legacy
consumers such as the user store, whether the database is available at all).

Every check that used to compare the raw config string inline now goes through
:meth:`is_db_mode`, so renaming the flag or adding a mode touches one file.
Use :meth:`validate_storage_mode` at startup to reject unknown values loudly
instead of silently falling back to file storage.
